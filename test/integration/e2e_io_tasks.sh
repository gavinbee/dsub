# Basic end to end test, driven by a --tasks file.
#
# This test use the default stock image (ubuntu:14.04).
#
# This test is designed to verify that file input and output path
# headers in a tasks file work correctly.
#
# The actual operation performed here is to download a BAM and compute
# the md5, writing it to <filename>.bam.md5.
#
# An input file (the BAM) is localized to a subdirectory of the default
# data directory.
# An output file (the MD5) is de-localized from a different subdirectory
# of the default data directory.
